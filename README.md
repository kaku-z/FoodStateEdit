# FoodStateEdit paper release workspace

This repository is the frozen, lightweight workspace for the 20-day
FoodStateEdit paper sprint started on 2026-08-26.

The historical experiment root, model weights, videos, and large output folders
remain outside this repository. This repository tracks source snapshots,
schemas, manifests, evaluation definitions, paper figures/tables, and the exact
paths and hashes needed to reproduce reported results.

## Frozen research task

Given a food image without the target manipulation, a structured action
specification, a utensil type, and sparse/local spatial controls, generate an
edited image that depicts the utensil manipulating the food while satisfying
material, contact, conservation, source-removal, and scene-preservation
constraints.

The task is structured-control image editing. It is not currently claimed to be
text-only, fully automatic, universally general, or universally photorealistic.

## Planned material/action families

- liquid: spoon scooping soup;
- granular: spoon or spatula scooping fried rice;
- strand: chopsticks lifting ramen or udon;
- strand-contact: fork twirling and lifting pasta.

## Start here

- `SCOPE_FREEZE.md`: claims, non-claims, gates, and change policy;
- `PROVENANCE.md`: upstream code, environment, model, and result hashes;
- `schemas/`: frozen case, run, and metric contracts;
- `benchmark/`: anchor and future pilot/test manifests;
- `results/CURRENT_RESULTS_INVENTORY.md`: evidence available at sprint start;
- `DAY1_CHECKLIST.md`: completion evidence for the first sprint day.
- `DAY2_CHECKLIST.md`: auditable entry point for the 60-case benchmark freeze.

## Local contract validation

From PowerShell in this repository, run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate_release.ps1
```

This check does not load or download model weights. It validates the copied
framework tests, JSON contracts, Python syntax, and the four frozen GeoEdit
override hashes.

## Large-file policy

No model weights or generated videos are committed. Every formal run must refer
to immutable paths plus file hashes in its run manifest. Existing weights must
be reused with download disabled.
